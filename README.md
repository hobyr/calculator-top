# Calculator (The Odin Project)

Calculator project from The Odin Project to complete the Foundations chapter. It
will be a good project to showcase what I've learned in HTML5, CSS3, and
JavaScript.

It will be a browser calculator, fully interactive to verify that I understand
the concepts behind programming web applications and websites.

I used this [color palette](https://coolors.co/palette/f8f9fa-e9ecef-dee2e6-ced4da-adb5bd-6c757d-495057-343a40-212529) for the design.
